# About AstroClient
AstroClient is a discord selfbot designed to make life easy!

# Installing AstroClient
AstroClient requires discord.js and hastebin-gen. These can both be installed from NPM.
Once you have all those required packages, edit astroclient.js and replace `token` with your discord token.
After that you can edit it to your liking and then just start it. The default prefix is `/`.

# Warning!!!
Discord is ran by uptight assholes so selfbots aren't allowed. Be careful not to get caught using AstroClient or the spooky discord nazis will get you!
